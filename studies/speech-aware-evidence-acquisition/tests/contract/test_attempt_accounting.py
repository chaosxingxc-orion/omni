"""Contract: one-time attempt accounting (R0 repair T4, invariant I6, campaign probe P4).

Independently reproduced defect (see task-4 brief): the frozen-core entry gate had
no nonce, attempt id or state machine. The identical ExecutionPlan, over the
identical pre-registered exposure-ledger row, opened the gate twice with no error,
and two independent FrozenCoreAdapter instances each metered their own in-process
counters from zero -- a row registered for N calls could be re-spent per
process/attempt indefinitely.

These probes exercise the fix through the REAL FrozenCoreGate (GateFixture) and
the real FrozenCoreAdapter, end to end -- not a stub gate (see
tests/unit/test_frozen_core_adapter.py and tests/unit/test_attempts.py for the
lower-level, gate-independent coverage of the same behaviors).
