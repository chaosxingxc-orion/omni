"""CLI (S3-3): score a grouped-Solver rollout's five raw samples on COPIES and
select the best/worst disagreement pair per row.

Model-free. The five raw Solver samples already exist in the sealed run's
``solver_group`` custody (I7g); this CLI renders each sample index's answer
across every row into one canonical outputs COPY (``analysis.
native_commit_replay.replay_row``'s / ``scripts.analysis.
slurp_verifier_measurement.render_answer``'s exact rendering, byte for byte),
scores each of the five copies ONCE through the registered official scorer
(never ``core.scoring_batch``, which scores a bundle-verified run directory
and every side here is a derived copy with no manifest and no bundle -- the
precedent is ``analysis.b8a_delivery_node_read`` /
``scripts.analysis.slurp_verifier_measurement.score_copy``), and picks the
best and worst sample per row by ``(slu_f1_f1, scenario_action_exact)`` with
a deterministic ascending-``sample_index`` tie-break. The delivered answer's
own official score is read from the run's SEALED ``<run_id>.scores.json``
(``sealed_per_sample``) -- never rescored -- which is why the contacts block
below reads ``scorer: <samples>`` and not ``<samples> + 1``.

No utterance text, gold label, transcript or model output is printed or
persisted anywhere by this CLI: ``per_row.json`` and ``pairs.json`` carry
ids, stratum names, sample indices, scores and hashes only. The rendered
outputs copies themselves DO carry the rendered JSON answer text (scenario /
action / entity type+filler), because the registered scorer needs it to
score against gold -- exactly as every other ``score_copy`` caller in this
repository writes; they are written under ``--analysis-root``, never under
the repository.

Stages (``--stage``): ``render`` (write the five per-sample-index outputs
copies), ``score`` (score each rendered copy once through ``--scorer-id``),
``pairs`` (build ``per_row.json`` and ``pairs.json`` from the scored sides
plus the sealed delivered scores and the roster's stratum), ``all`` (the
three in sequence). Every stage is idempotent: a copy or score file that
already exists on disk is read back, never rewritten.

S3-4s (owner decision 106, 2026-09-23): the whole TRAJECTORY
--------------------------------------------------------------
"Roll out as much information as possible; we are doing SYSTEM-level
optimisation." ``pairs.json`` therefore carries, per DISAGREEING row, a
``trajectory`` block rebuilt from the SEALED episode receipt (cell ROLL-1 is
not re-flown): the Perception candidate ids in order and whether the
construction gold intent is among them, the best and worst Solver sample
indices with their answer hashes, the delivered path after the commit (the
Reviewer verdict labels and primitive ids per iteration, the Planner action
labels, the revision count, the delivery kind and whether the delivered
answer scores below the best sample), and the per-node completion tokens and
truncation flags. IDS, LABELS, COUNTS AND HASHES ONLY -- exactly the
discipline the rest of this CLI keeps; no statement, transcript, gold label
or model output text is ever written to ``pairs.json``.

Two of those facts do not live in the episode receipt and are read from the
sealed attempt's own ``<run_id>.trace.jsonl`` instead, joined by request id:
per-contact ``usage.completion_tokens`` (``MODEL_RESPONSE``) and per-contact
``finish_reason`` (``MODEL_WIRE_RESPONSE``), and, for the Perception visit
ONLY, the response text -- opened here to read back the ordered candidate
``intent_id``s and discarded, exactly as this CLI already opens sealed
Solver answers to render and score them. One more fact does not live in
either: the construction GOLD intent. It is read, when available, from the
construction roster's own annotation or from an explicit ``--gold-intents``
map, and it enters ``pairs.json`` only as the boolean
``gold_intent_in_candidates`` and a count.

Whatever a given seal does not carry is reported ABSENT with a named reason
rather than guessed: cell ROLL-1's own ``native_episode`` fragment arms
neither ``reviewer_verdict`` (item E37) nor ``role_context``, so its receipt
carries no ``reviewer_verdicts`` key -- the Reviewer verdict labels are then
re-derived from the sealed Reviewer response text with the registered
closed-vocabulary parser (``rails.review_primitives.parse_review_primitive``),
which is the same reading the armed path would have sealed, and the block
says which source it used.

Parallelism (2026-09-26)
------------------------
``--workers`` fans the ``score`` stage out over the rendered copies through
``analysis.parallel.map_by_key``: one worker process per COMPLETE official
scoring, collected by copy name and read back in sorted name order. Nothing
is sharded -- each task is the same whole ``score_copy`` over the same whole
copy -- and the numbers do not depend on the worker count.

``render`` and ``pairs`` stay in one process: they are seconds of work beside
minutes of scoring. ``--mode supply-variants``'s own scoring stays serial too,
deliberately: it validates each arm's row identities AGAINST THE PREVIOUS
arm's while it iterates, and each call writes an exclusive source-bound
receipt through ``core.scoring_batch.score_complete_derived_copy``, so making
it concurrent is a change to that receipt's exclusivity rather than a
scheduling change.

    row's Solver contacts live in the predecessor attempt's trace, so each
    contact is looked up in the bundle's own trace first, then in that row's
    own predecessor trace only. Every contact's response digest must also
    equal the sealed branch record's own ``solver_response_text_sha256`` for
    the branch at the same index, so a column can never be filled from
    another branch's answer.
