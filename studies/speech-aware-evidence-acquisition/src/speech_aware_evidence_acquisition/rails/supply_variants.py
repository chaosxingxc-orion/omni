"""Per-row supply-variant interleaving at ONE node (item E42, family VAR-2).

WHY THIS EXISTS. Compare declared supply actions within a shared predecessor
state. This reduces between-flight differences in the prefix but does not
establish a statistical power multiplier: the historical ROLL-AA row-mean F1
interval and cross-flight pooled-F1 intervals use different estimands.

WHAT THE FORM IS. One node, K arms, one episode, one row: the same node is
contacted K times over the SAME ``QueryState``, each time with a DIFFERENT
declared knowledge-supply construction, and the episode delivers exactly ONE
of them. It is the grouped Solver sampler (item E2, ``rails.
native_episode_config`` / ``reproduction.ojw.native_group_solver``) with the
varied axis moved from DECODING to SUPPLY:

* E2 varies ``temperature``/``seed`` per sample at request-composition time
  (``reproduction.ojw.native_request.compose_solver_sample_decoding_params``)
  and delivers the commit policy's aggregate;
* E42 varies the SUPPLIED EVIDENCE per arm at binding-composition time and
  delivers the DELIVERING arm's own raw response.

WHY THE DELIVERING ARM CARRIES NO OVERRIDES AND COMES LAST. Two invariants
this module refuses to weaken:

1. *The delivered request is the locked plan's request, byte for byte.* The
   delivering arm is rendered from the episode's own ``QueryState``, with no
   arm-scoped view of any kind -- it is not "a narrowing that reproduces the
   plan", it IS the ordinary path, so its bytes are identical by construction
   rather than by claim. That is what makes the delivering arm the read's
   baseline and the within-flight comparator for every other arm.
2. *Invariant I7 (the delivered text is a model response) holds with no new
   exception.* The delivering arm is the LAST arm of the group, so the role
   result's ``actor_output`` IS the last contact's own completion text and
   ``rails.runner``'s existing delivery binding check ("native delivery is not
   bound to its actual source response") passes unchanged. A grouped Solver
   visit needs an explicit ``solver_group`` bypass there because its delivered
   text is an AGGREGATE; an arm group needs none.

WHAT AN ARM DOES **NOT** TOUCH. An arm may override exactly the supply
selection knobs of :data:`SUPPLY_VARIANT_KNOB_TAILS`, on its OWN node's phase,
in a store the fragment already declares. It therefore cannot reach the model
fragment, the decoding params, the serving geometry, the prompt order, the task
contract, the tool authority, the role graph, the phase program or the
response format: none of those is addressable by a knob path this module
admits, and an unknown path is refused by name before any contact.

THE ONE NAMED EXCEPTION: THE RELEASE-SWAP ROUTE. Coordinator amendment,
2026-09-28 (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-27-same-flight-supply-variant-
instrument-design.md, "Coordinator amendment (2026-09-28)"): an arm may
ADDITIONALLY declare :class:`SupplyVariantReleaseSwap`, naming ONE store the
fragment already declares and ONE alternate release relpath that store's base
config ALSO declares under ``knowledge_stores.<store>.alternates`` --
pinned, hash-verified bytes exactly like the primary, never a component this
module discovers on its own. This is the sole exception to "an arm re-caps a
selection, it never swaps a component or repoints a release": every other
sentence in this docstring, and every refusal below, still holds for the
knob-tail route. The delivering arm and its twin (``replicate_of``) never
carry one, for the same reason neither carries a knob override.

THE NODE-TEMPLATE KIND (NX programme, items E1/E2, 2026-10-09). A group
parsed by :func:`parse_template_variants` is the same form with the varied axis
moved from SUPPLY to the node's INSTRUCTION TEMPLATE: each non-delivering,
non-twin arm overrides exactly ONE thing -- ``phase_material.<role>.
instruction_template``, a hash-pinned relpath under ``probes/`` -- and nothing
else (no knob, no release swap, no supply of its own). The supply is therefore
UNVARIED: every arm renders the delivering arm's own evidence, which the v4
receipt (:data:`SUPPLY_VARIANT_RECEIPT_SCHEMA_V4`) states and its validator
checks. The delivering arm is still LAST and carries no override, so invariants
I7 and I7v hold unchanged and the delivered request is the locked plan's, byte
for byte. Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-09-slurp-nx-node-template-
variant-instrument-design.md.

CUSTODY, AND THE ONE DIVERGENCE THIS FORM INTRODUCES. Every arm's request,
resolved knobs, supplied value ids and item count are sealed under the arm's
own id, and the K contacts are recorded as ONE ``AgentContactBatch`` with
``fanout_semantics="action_alternatives"`` -- so all K bind the SAME
``query_state_sha256``, exactly as the K samples of a grouped Solver visit do.
For the DELIVERING arm the sealed ``QueryState`` describes its request exactly.
For a NON-DELIVERING arm it does not: that arm's request carried its own
resolved selection, which the episode's state never claimed. That divergence is
this form's whole point, and it is made checkable rather than silent:
:func:`validate_supply_variant_receipt` requires the delivering arm's rendered
id list to equal the row's own ``retrieved_value_ids`` and every other arm's
ids to be declared, ordered and counted in its own receipt row.

    """Parse ``native_episode.roles.perception.branches``, fail-closed.

    Structurally :func:`parse_supply_variants`'s twin (design section 3,
    "Fork point"), with the differences design section 1 names: a branch may
    target the program's first phase (indeed must, for a boundary-supply
    knob); a branch's release_swap, presentation or response-contract axis is
    admitted through the same "one factor" rule a knob override is; and the
    group additionally declares ``level`` (1 or 2, design section 1) and
    requires exactly one twin (T) branch (design section 4, "A/A = twin").

    ``registered_presentation_ids`` is ``core.base.PERCEPTION_PRESENTATIONS
    .names()`` -- this module does not import ``core.base`` itself, so a
    caller that omits it gets shape checking only, exactly as
    ``declared_stores=None`` does for a knob's store. ``max_candidates_ceiling``
    bounds ``min_candidates`` the same way; a caller that omits it gets no
    upper check beyond "positive integer". ``top2_contrast_presentation_id``
    is ``rails.perception_presentations.TOP2_CONTRAST_PRESENTATION_ID`` --
    passed in by name for the same reason ``registered_presentation_ids`` is
    (this module does not import that registering module either); a caller
    that omits it gets no coupling check between ``presentation_id`` and
    ``contrast_pairs`` beyond each field's own shape.

    The refusals, in order, each raised by name BEFORE any contact:

    1. a block that is not an object with exactly ``branches``,
       ``fit_estimate`` and ``level``;
    2. a ``level`` outside :data:`PERCEPTION_BRANCH_LEVELS`;
    3. a branch row with unknown or missing keys;
    4. a branch count outside :data:`MIN_PERCEPTION_BRANCHES` ..
       :data:`MAX_PERCEPTION_BRANCHES`;
    5. a branch id collision;
    6. zero or several branches carrying ``deliver`` (branch A), or a
       delivering branch that is not the LAST branch, or that carries any
       axis at all;
    7. zero or several branches naming ``replicate_of`` the delivering
       branch (exactly one twin T is required), a twin naming a branch that
       is not the delivering branch, or a twin that carries any axis;
    8. more than :data:`MAX_PERCEPTION_B_BRANCHES` B branches (beside A
       and T);
    9. an override path this module does not admit
       (:func:`parse_perception_branch_knob`);
    10. a release_swap naming an undeclared store or an undeclared
        alternate (:func:`parse_supply_variant_release_swap`);
    11. a presentation_id absent from ``registered_presentation_ids``, when
        given;
    12. a min_candidates outside ``1 .. max_candidates_ceiling``, when given;
    13. a non-A, non-T branch declaring zero or more than one axis category
        -- "one factor per non-A branch" (design section 1);
    14. two B branches whose whole axis is identical;
    15. a branch whose estimated prompt exceeds the live slot with the
        registered reserve;
    16. a malformed ``contrast_pairs`` pin (not exactly ``{relpath, sha256}``,
        with sha256 a lowercase 64-hex SHA-256);
    17. a branch whose ``presentation_id`` equals ``top2_contrast_
        presentation_id`` and carries no ``contrast_pairs``, or a branch
        whose ``presentation_id`` differs (including ``None``) and carries
        one anyway, when ``top2_contrast_presentation_id`` is given;
    18. ``contrast_pairs`` on A or its twin T (like ``prepared_seed``,
        neither may carry a branch-owned pin);
    19. a malformed ``key_source`` block, one naming an undeclared store, or
        one that swaps zero pins (:func:`parse_perception_branch_key_source`);
    20. ``key_source`` on A or its twin T (refusals 6/7: neither declares an
        axis -- AT-P1/P2 hold because A and T never see a swapped key).

    ``key_source`` counts as ONE axis category (refusal 13) however many of
    its three pins it swaps, exactly as a knob tuple does.

    ``delivering_axes_admitted`` (evidence-consumption module, migration
    step 4, coordinator ruling R3) lifts refusal 6 for exactly the named
    axes -- a subset of :data:`DELIVERING_BRANCH_MODULE_AXES` -- on A only:
    the module's own delivered Perception policy may carry an ADMITTED
    presentation (with its ``contrast_pairs`` pin) or response contract. The
    twin T still declares no axis and resolves A's request, axes included.
    Only ``rails.native_episode_config`` passes it, and only for a config
    whose declared ``native_episode.consumption_module`` compiles those axes
    onto A; a hand-written block (the default ``()``) keeps refusal 6 whole.

    """One branch's receipt row (design section 3, "Receipt").

    ``solver_absent``/``absent_reason`` (NX-T R1 seal fix, 2026-10-15) mark a NON-delivering level-2 branch whose Solver contact
    ended on a finite completion: the row still names that real, metered contact through the four level-2 fields, and gains the
    two optional keys ``solver_absent`` (true) and ``absent_reason`` (the code path). A row that is not absent is byte-identical
    to every row sealed before this change.

    ``thinking_group`` (NX-T R1) selects the v5 row shape: the v3 row plus ``thinking_policy`` -- ``None`` for A and the twin,
    the declared override map for every other branch.

    ``template_group`` (NX programme E1, Perception node) selects the v4 row
    shape: the v3 row plus ``instruction_template`` -- ``None`` for A and the
    twin, the declared ``{relpath, sha256}`` for every other branch.

    ``note_parse_status``/``candidate_intent_ids``/
    ``candidate_intent_ids_raw_count`` (schema v2) are exactly what
    ``rails.native_episode_receipt.parse_perception_branch_note`` returned for
    the branch's note: the collapsed, possibly empty list plus the listed count
    (``None`` defaults it to the list length -- a note with no duplicates).
    Any consistent triple is a measured outcome; only an inconsistent one is
    refused.

    The four ``solver_*``/``candidate_supply_value_ids`` fields are declared
    together or not at all: level 1 never supplies them, level 2 supplies
    them for every branch (A's naming its own ordinary first Solver visit,
    every other branch's naming the one Solver contact its note fanned out
    -- design section 3, "Level 2").

    ``presentation_skip_reason``/``contrast_block_sha256`` ("What to build"
    item 2) are the rendered outcome of the branch's own ``presentation_id``:
    at most one of the two is ever non-``None`` (a block either rendered --
    ``contrast_block_sha256`` -- or was skipped and says why -- ``
    presentation_skip_reason``), and both are ``None`` for a branch that
    declares no ``presentation_id`` (A, T, and every non-presentation B
    branch). ``min_candidates_met`` ("What to build" item 3) is ``None``
    unless ``branch.min_candidates`` is declared, in which case it is
    whatever this branch's own note parse found -- a bool, never a refusal:
    a short list is a measured outcome, not a defect.
