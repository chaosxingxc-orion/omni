# ONE complete official SLURP test-split read happens at the end of Stage 3,
# and its preparations (roster freeze, D1 media supplement, featcache packets,
# speech query vectors) are registered now and built ahead of time so the read
# waits on nothing.
#
# Section 6.3 of the one-shot read protocol draft
# (``docs/readiness/2026-09-19-slurp-test-split-one-read-protocol-v1-draft.md``,
# commit 16ed5b3f) states the shape of the remedy this block implements: "a
# paired code change admitting a machine role for it -- because no faithful
# role for final reporting exists in STAGE2_SPLIT_ROLES and 'confirmatory' is
# refused outright -- with its tests and the amendment cited in the code ...
# the code change should admit a role named for what it is (for example
# ``final-report``), never reuse ``dev``". Section 6.2 records why reusing
# ``dev`` would be exactly the relabeling the guard forbids: ``dev`` means
# "legal to calibrate against, never a final-reporting split".
#
# So ``final-report`` is admitted, and it is admitted FAIL-CLOSED. It is NOT a
# member of ``STAGE2_SPLIT_ROLES``: a plan carrying it is refused unless every
# one of the following holds, and each failure names what is missing.
#
#   1. the plan carries ``owner_allowance`` = {path, sha256};
#   2. ``path`` is a repo-relative POSIX path under ``docs/receipts/owner/``;
#   3. the execution profile is ``bounded-discovery-probe``;
#   4. the file exists and its BYTES hash to the pinned sha256;
#   5. it is a ``saea-owner-split-allowance-v1`` document of this study;
#   6. its ``status`` is exactly ``"authorised"``;
#   7. its ``split`` names this plan's carrier and split identity hash;
#   8. its ``permitted_run_ids`` contains this plan's run id, and partitions
#      into ``read_run_ids`` + ``preparation_run_ids``;
#   9. it names the dated owner decision, and states in ``venue`` why the read
#      and its preparations are not promoted to a ``papers/<slug>`` repository
#      (protocol section 6.2, Remedy A, which the draft recommends).
#
# The receipt committed today carries ``status: "pending-owner"``, so TODAY
# every ``final-report`` plan is refused at check 6. Decision 108 is the single
# owner ruling that unlocks it; flipping the status changes the receipt's bytes,
# which breaks every pinned sha256 until each is deliberately re-pinned.
#
# ``contracts`` stays dependency-free of ``core`` (see ``gate.py``'s
# circular-import note), so the receipt is read and hashed here with the
# standard library alone.

#: The machine role of a final-reporting read and of the label-free preparation
