"""Fail-closed E0 engineering contracts.

Model-free contracts frozen by the current owner execution authority
(``SAEA-OWNER-CONSOLIDATED-EXECUTION-CONTRACT-2026-08-04``; the earlier
``SAEA-OWNER-SPEECH-SCOPE-AND-IDENTITY-2026-08-04`` is an inherited source record, not the
current contract): the runtime information boundary, OBS/ORG/SUPPLY/USE trace separation,
exposure-claim schema, the Stage-2 execution-scope guard with its structured
``ExecutionPlan``, and the frozen-core entry gate. Everything here is standard-library only
so the contracts are testable before any ML stack is installed and before any model is
touched.

CHANGED GUARANTEE (owner decision 2026-08-06, docs/owner-decisions-pending.md item 7):
``FrozenCoreGate`` no longer re-hashes the pinned ~34.7 GB GGUF set from bytes on every
gate open. It defaults to a cheap-identity fast path (size + last-modified time + OS file
identity against a cache bound to the runtime receipt's own SHA-256), falling back to a
genuine full SHA-256 re-hash on any cache miss/mismatch, on explicit request
(``full_hash=True``), or at least once per process/session for a real model touch
(the gate's own default). Runtime libraries under ``build/bin`` are UNCHANGED: always fully
hashed, unconditionally, every time (they are ~249 MB, cheap, and are the code that runs).
Stated precisely: the fast path defends against a WRONG, PARTIAL, or ACCIDENTALLY-REPLACED
model set (a swapped-in file, a truncated/resumed download, a stale/foreign data root) — it
does NOT defend against an adversary who edits a GGUF file's bytes in place while
deliberately preserving its size, mtime and OS file identity. See
``FrozenCoreGate._validate_runtime`` and the module comment above
``_SESSION_FULL_HASH_DONE`` for the exact mechanics.

R0 repair refactor stage 1 (behaviour-preserving): this used to be one ~2200-line
``contracts.py`` module. It is now this package, split by concern (errors, the
ExecutionPlan/scope guard, the runtime information boundary, the exposure-ledger
parser, receipt/identity measurement helpers, and the FrozenCoreGate assembly split
across four validation mixins) purely for file size -- every name below was already
part of this module's public surface and remains importable from exactly
``speech_aware_evidence_acquisition.contracts`` as before.

from __future__ import annotations

# NOTE: core.attempts is imported lazily (function-local, see
# _require_exposure_preregistration) rather than at module scope. core/__init__.py
# eagerly imports core.model, which imports THIS module (contracts.py) for
# ExecutionPlan -- a module-level `from .core.attempts import ...` here would make
# importing contracts.py first trigger core/__init__.py, which would try to import
# core.model, which would try to import contracts.py while it is still mid-load
# (ExecutionPlan not yet defined): a circular import. A local import deferred until
# the method actually runs sidesteps this: by then contracts.py has always already
# finished loading.
#
# (R0 repair refactor stage 1: preserved verbatim from the pre-split module. No
# submodule below actually imports core.attempts any more -- the slice-wide
# summation that used it was retired by the 2026-08-06 owner amendment -- but the
# note is kept as-is per the refactor's behaviour-preserving, no-drive-by-fixes
# rule; see the refactor report.)
