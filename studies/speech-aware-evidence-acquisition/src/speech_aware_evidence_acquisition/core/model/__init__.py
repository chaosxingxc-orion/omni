"""Frozen-core adapter and transports: the ONLY model request path (R0).

Discipline (docs/engineering.md): the gate is checked in the same process
that sends requests (no check-then-run-elsewhere TOCTOU gap); the D2 per-arm
visible-field allowlist is enforced as an exact key set on every request —
the choke point that makes a leakage a hard error rather than a convention.
The real llama-server endpoint shape is confirmed at R0 smoke time against
the receipt-pinned build — tests inject `post` and never open a socket.

R0 repair refactor stage 1 (behaviour-preserving): this used to be one
~730-line ``model.py`` module. It is now this package (``paths.py`` for the
shared media-path helpers, ``adapter.py`` for ``FrozenCoreAdapter``,
``transport.py`` for ``LlamaServerTransport`` + its ``TRANSPORTS``
registration) purely for file size -- every name below was already part of
this module's public surface and remains importable from exactly
``speech_aware_evidence_acquisition.core.model`` as before.

R0 repair refactor stage 2 (part C, pure move, no behaviour change):
``adapter.py`` itself further split into ``lifecycle.py``
(``_AttemptLifecycleMixin``) and ``request_types.py`` (``CoreResponse``/
``ALLOWED_DECODING_KEYS``/``_canonical``) -- same "every name stays
importable from exactly this package" guarantee.
