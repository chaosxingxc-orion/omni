"""Bundle verification: recompute every hash from bytes on disk; trust nothing else.

Split out of the former monolithic ``core/bundle.py`` (R0 repair refactor
stage 1, pure move, no behaviour change). R0 repair refactor stage 2 (part C):
the manifest-header checks (schema/study/status, ``study_commit`` shape,
``scorers`` shape+registration, COMPLETED-only presence/marker refusals)
moved to ``verify_header.py``'s ``_verify_manifest_header``, again purely for
file size and again a pure move -- it only ever reads ``manifest`` and
returns the validated ``status``, feeding nothing else back into this module.
