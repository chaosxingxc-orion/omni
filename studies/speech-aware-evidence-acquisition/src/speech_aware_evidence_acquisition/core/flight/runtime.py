"""``FlightRuntime``: the one harness every arm and carrier flies through
(C4c consolidation).

Six stages, always run in this order, each producing exactly one hash-bound
receipt (``core.flight.receipts.FlightReceipts``) and refusing to run out of
order or twice:

``preflight -> preprocess -> serve -> run_phases -> seal -> score``

Every stage that could otherwise reach a model, a GPU, llama-server, an
embedding tool, or the network is reached ONLY through an injectable seam
(``session_starter``, ``transport_factory``, ``gate_factory``,
``rails_runner``, ``phase_runner``, ``score_batch``, ``packet_promoter``,
``client_factory``, ...); every seam defaults to the real production
primitive it wraps, but this module itself never imports anything that
performs I/O against a live server. Unit tests inject fakes for every seam
and never touch a server (module docstring's own hard rule) -- a real flight
is a later, separately preregistered step (see the residual list in the C4c
report).

This module composes primitives that already exist and are owned elsewhere
in this study; it invents no new model-facing behaviour. See each stage
method's own docstring for exactly which existing function it calls.

    owner decision 106) EXACTLY ONCE on top of whatever seeded the first
    phase.

    The first phase has no preceding ``advance`` to carry a per-row
    decision, so its supply is SEEDED. The seed comes from one of two
    places: a prepared, hash-pinned artifact
    (:meth:`_load_phase_supply_seed`) or the store router's own
    ``bootstrap_first_phase``. The latter composes the route itself
    (``rails.knowledge_stores``), so this function exists for the seeds
    that route does not produce.

    A prepared artifact looked like exactly such a seed and is not:
    :meth:`prepare_phase_supply` derives it THROUGH this same
    :meth:`_phase_supply_seeds` (item E16 -- ONE identity computation,
    one producer), which for a store-routed cell means through
    ``bootstrap_first_phase``. So the artifact ALREADY carries the
    route's own qualified value ids, at the tail of every row it was
    prepared over, and appending them again refused cell CELL-1's
    generation smoke before its first contact (2026-09-23, zero calls:
    four ``stage3-deltas`` deltas seeded twice on every row).

    Hence ``seeded_from_artifact``. For an artifact seed the route is
    VERIFIED rather than appended: a row already ending in exactly this
    route's ids is left untouched, and a row carrying none of them (an
    artifact prepared before the store declared the route -- the case
    this seam was written for) still has them appended. A partial
    overlap is never repaired silently. Every other caller keeps the
    strict rule, under which any overlap at all is a genuine duplicate
    and refuses.

    Byte-identical no-op for every flight whose router publishes no
    ``unconditional_first_phase`` seam -- which is every flight written
    before S3-4s, and every flight whose stores declare no such route.

    the envelope through the resident server) and
    :meth:`FlightRuntime._verify_phase_prompt_fit` (which re-renders it at
    pre-flight time and refuses on any difference).

    Per phase the instruction is the rendered static text, plus the
    predecessor binding's own suffix:

    * ``none`` -- nothing appended; the envelope is EXACT.
    * ``sealed-manifest`` -- the state this sample's row was sealed with,
      from ``sealed_states_by_phase[phase][sample_id]``; also EXACT, and
      genuinely per-sample.
    * ``sealed-samples-manifest`` -- the candidate BLOCK this sample's row
      renders from an external grouped-Solver bundle, from the same mapping;
      also EXACT and per-sample, and loaded by the same
      ``rails.phase_material.sealed_states_for_spec`` the flight binding uses.
    * ``append-sealed-state`` -- the predecessor is this run's own preceding
      response and does not exist yet, so the instruction is padded with
      ``completion_token_ceiling`` tokens' worth of ASCII: an upper bound,
      never an under-count.

    A ``sealed-manifest`` phase with no state supplied falls back to the same
    pad, so a caller that deliberately measures the bound (this runtime's own
    ``_phase_prompt_payloads`` estimate) and a caller that measures the exact
    text share one code path.

    ``supply_blocks_by_phase`` (E6) is the traced knowledge a SUPPLIED phase
    carries, in the exact ``"[evidence <id>] <content>"`` wire form. It never
    touches the instruction -- that is the whole point of the traced channel
    -- but it IS part of the request, so a prompt estimate that omitted it
    would under-count exactly the cell the estimate exists for. ``None`` by
    default and byte-identical to the pre-E6 rendering.

    ``state_fill_by_phase`` is the LAST thing appended, after the state block
    -- the same position and the same blank-line join
    ``rails.phase_material.build_material_for_phase`` uses, which is the real
    runtime path. It is ``None`` by default and the rendering is then
    byte-identical to what it always was, so a pinned
    :data:`PHASE_PROMPT_FIT_SCHEMA` receipt measured before this parameter
    existed still verifies. A caller that renders a phase declaring
    ``state_fill`` and does NOT pass its fill is counting a prompt shorter
    than the one that goes on the wire (for KC-S1b, by roughly 7,500 tokens),
    which is why :meth:`FlightRuntime._phase_prompt_payloads` resolves and
    passes them.

        """The binding a PREPARED ARTIFACT's identity is computed against.

        E10b (2026-09-18). A prepared artifact -- ``prepared/<run>/phase-
        supply-v<N>.json`` and its recall twin -- is produced, and re-verified
        by ``core.flight.repin``, over the cell's WHOLE roster. Its identity
        therefore embeds the whole roster's packet map
        (:meth:`_phase_seed_inputs`, ``sources["packets"]``). A
        resume-recovery narrows ``speech_packet_bindings`` to the rows it
        re-flies, so computing the identity from the dispatch binding compared
        a 500-row map against a 1,080-row artifact and refused with "prepared
        artifact identity mismatch" -- with ZERO contacts, but only after
        preflight, preprocess and serve had been paid for (2026-09-18, the
        first resume-recovery flight of the B4b replicate).

        The rule this method carries: identity is a property of the CELL, not
        of how much of it one attempt happens to fly. The resume narrowing
        applies to what is dispatched, never to what is verified.

        Returns ``binding`` itself for every ordinary flight, so no identity
        moves and no uninterrupted flight changes by a byte.

        Narrowed-binding consumers, audited 2026-09-18 (E10b):

        * :meth:`_phase_seed_inputs` -- IDENTITY. Widened here, which covers
          all four of its callers (:meth:`prepare_phase_supply`,
          :meth:`prepare_phase_recall`, :meth:`_load_phase_supply_seed`,
          :meth:`_load_phase_recall`).
        * :meth:`_load_phase_supply_seed` -- IDENTITY plus a roster check.
          Verifies against the full roster, then restricts the loaded
          selections to the dispatched rows, because
          ``rails.runner._per_sample_bootstrap`` refuses a seed naming a
          sample outside the flown split.
        * :meth:`_load_phase_recall` -- IDENTITY plus a roster check. Reached
          only from :meth:`_resolve_phase_supply`, which runs while the
          binding is BUILT and therefore always sees the full roster; widened
          here anyway so the invariant does not depend on call order.
        * ``build_bootstrap_selection`` / ``bootstrap_first_phase`` (the
          un-prepared seed routes) -- no identity. Both are per-row pure
          functions over a sorted roster, so the narrowed map computes exactly
          the flown rows' own bytes and nothing else. Left narrowed on
          purpose: a recovery must not pay to re-select rows it will not fly.
        * :meth:`_build_phase_tool_dispatcher` -- reads the snapshot, supply
          and store bindings, never the packet map. No roster, no identity.
        * The ``native_episode`` binding, ``source_options``, the trace sink
          and the review/supply objects -- roster free.
        * ``dispatch["parent_sample_count"]`` -- execution-unit receipts only,
          and :meth:`_load_resume_predecessor` refuses an execution-unit
          roster outright, so a resume never reaches it.
        * ``initial_feedback_states`` -- carried whole, and ``rails.runner``
          demands it bind every active sample exactly once. Unreachable under
          a resume by construction: a resume requires a ``native_episode``
          dispatch and :meth:`_prepared_feedback_binding` refuses the
          ``native-role-episode`` stop rule.
        * The live request-fit gate, :meth:`_verify_prepared_request_fit`,
          ``validate_speech_packet_set`` and :meth:`_merged_canonical_rows` --
          all outside the narrowing: the first takes its active roster from
          :meth:`_flight_roster_sample_ids` (which rows fly, correctly
          resume-aware), the middle two run in preflight/preprocess before any
          narrowing exists, and the seal merges against ``self._samples``.
        * ``rails.runner``'s own split, ``adapter.load_split(split_id)`` --
          NOT reached by the narrowing at all, which is the E10c defect. The
          adapter stays whole and the flown roster is handed to the runner
          explicitly instead (:meth:`_resume_dispatch_roster`), so identity
          and the seal keep reading the cell's whole roster while the loop
          flies the recovery's own.

        A phase's own instruction rides the payload's ORG/CONTROL history
        turn, so the adapter's bare ``assemble_prompt`` -- what the direct
        path estimates over -- is not the request a phase program sends. For
        a cell whose select phase carries a tool registry that is thousands
        of tokens of difference, i.e. exactly the kind of miss a prompt-fit
        estimate exists to catch. This renders each phase through
        :func:`render_phase_prompt_envelopes`, the same one authority the
        pinned prompt-fit measurement and its verification use.

        WHY EVERY SAMPLE, NOT ONE (KC-S1's defect 3, 2026-09-05). This used
        to render ONE representative row and apply no ``state_fill`` at all.
        Both under-count, and a prompt budget that under-counts is worse than
        none: for KC-S1b the estimate was about 7,500 tokens short of the
        widest real request, so its ALLOW said nothing about the phase cell
        that actually flies. What is rendered now, per sample:

        * the sample's OWN system text (``phase_program_system_text``, which
          is ``rails.runner._agent_messages``' rule -- the adapter's
          assembled system content plus its task contract when the
          instruction does not already carry it) and its OWN packet
          descriptor;
        * for a ``sealed-manifest`` phase, that sample's REAL sealed
          predecessor state, rebuilt from the pinned manifest exactly as
          :meth:`_verify_phase_prompt_fit` rebuilds it;
        * for a phase declaring a ``state_fill``, the fill's per-sample text,
          appended last, as ``rails.phase_material.build_material_for_phase``
          appends it on the wire.

        The one remaining approximation stays, and stays in the SAFE
        direction: an ``append-sealed-state`` phase's predecessor is this
        run's own preceding response and does not exist yet, so it is padded
        with the completion-token ceiling's worth of ASCII, which is exactly
        what bounds it. A state fill over that pad renders the fill's own
        fallback, which is its widest output.

        The maximum is taken on SERIALIZED BYTES, not on tokens: this method
        is the fail-early estimate and must not pay a real tokenizer 3 x
        1,000 times at pre-flight; :meth:`_assess_prompt_budget` counts
        tokens once per phase on the payload chosen here. The exact

        exhaustive trajectory-capacity receipts. Exact native requests still
        require native_contact_fit immediately before dispatch.

        Named-store values remain visible after supply. Linear programs retain
        blocks in declaration order. Native role execution and refresh loops do
        not follow declaration order, so every candidate envelope is conservatively
        unioned into every native role. Each allowed refresh adds another
        potentially disjoint selection, capped by the store snapshot size. This
        can overestimate an early request but cannot omit a retained candidate card
        from a later request.

        A fragment opts in by declaring BOTH ``prompt_fit_receipt`` (a plain
        relative path under this study repository) and
        ``prompt_fit_receipt_sha256``. Neither key present is the pre-existing
        behaviour: nothing is verified and ``None`` is returned. One key
        without the other is refused -- a receipt path with no hash pins
        nothing.

        What is checked, in order, each fail-closed:

        1. the receipt file's own sha256 equals the configured one;
        2. it carries schema :data:`PHASE_PROMPT_FIT_SCHEMA`;
        3. this flight's ``policy`` is a phase program (a receipt of this
           schema describes per-phase envelopes and means nothing otherwise);
        4. the receipt carries exactly ONE cell naming this flight's four
           config fragments -- the receipt says which measurement belongs to
           which cell and this runtime never guesses. The cell's recorded
           ``config_hash`` is provenance, never the match key: a receipt is
           measured from a fragment that does not yet pin it, and pinning it
           changes that very hash;
        5. that cell's phases are exactly the program's phases;
        6. for EVERY phase, re-rendering the envelope for the sample the
           receipt records as its maximum -- through
           :func:`render_phase_prompt_envelopes`, the same function the
           measurement used -- reproduces the recorded ``envelope_sha256``.

        Step 6 is the point of the whole mechanism: a receipt measured
        against an instruction, a registry, a template, a task contract, a
        prompt order or a packet binding that has since changed no longer
        describes what would go on the wire, and a flight that trusted it
        would be certifying a fit for a prompt it is not sending.

        This does NOT replace :meth:`_assess_prompt_budget`; that estimate
        runs unchanged beside it.

        """Item E42 (2026-09-25, family VAR-2): the per-arm supply resolver.

        ``None`` on the unarmed arm, which is every cell written before E42
        and every cell that does not declare ``roles.solver.supply_variants``;
        the runner then never reaches a line of the arm seam and refuses a
        resolver it did not ask for.

        Armed, this builds ONE knowledge-store router per declared arm -- the
        delivering arm included -- from a copy of this cell's own composed
        values with that arm's declared selection knobs re-capped, over the
        SAME released, hash-pinned stores, the SAME composite snapshot and the
        SAME router options the delivering router was built with. Three
        consequences the form depends on:

        * every arm reads the same frozen knowledge and the same evidence
          pins, so an arm can never reach bytes the cell did not release;
        * an arm's value ids are store-qualified exactly as the delivering
          arm's are, so they resolve in the ONE composite snapshot every
          request renders from;
        * the delivering arm's router is built INDEPENDENTLY of the flight's
          own ``supply_for_phase``, which is what makes ``rails.runner``'s
          live equality check on it a re-derivation rather than a restatement.

        Coordinator amendment, 2026-09-28: an arm that declares a
        ``release_swap`` (never the delivering arm or its twin) is the ONE
        exception -- its router is built over the base's own alternate
        release+snapshot for that ONE named store instead, via
        :meth:`_supply_action_router`'s own ``release_swap`` parameter.

        The W4-SV blocker fix (same amendment): a release-swap arm's REQUEST
        must also RENDER from that alternate binding -- ``rails.runner``'s
        ``base_messages`` otherwise renders every arm from the flight's own
        composite snapshot regardless of which store an arm's router
        selected, so an alternate release that keeps the primary's value ids
        (a content-only revision) would render the primary's bytes and the
        arm would be a silent second twin. ``resolve.release_swap_snapshots``
        (``{arm_id: KnowledgeSnapshot}``, one entry per release-swap arm) is
        the flight-owned answer ``rails.runner.supply_variant_messages`` reads
        it from -- bolted onto the returned resolver exactly as
        ``supply_for_phase.prefetch_recall`` is bolted onto that sibling seam
        -- and every OTHER store of that alternate binding is guaranteed
        (refused above, in :meth:`_supply_action_router`) to resolve to
        exactly the base's own pins, so rendering the WHOLE arm from the
        alternate binding's own composite snapshot is exactly equivalent to
        rendering only the one named store from it. The same alternate
        binding's ``store_receipt`` is also folded into
        ``self._phase_supply_receipt['supply_variant_release_swaps']``, keyed
        by arm id -- the flight-owned record of which release/snapshot hashes
        a release-swap arm actually resolved, present for that arm alone
        (the delivering arm and its twin never carry a ``release_swap`` and
        so never appear there).

        The routers are built once, at assembly, before any contact. Nothing
        here touches a model, a tokenizer or the network.

        the program's first phase and has no preceding ``advance`` to resolve
        against -- design section 0), so this method computes each branch's
        seed through the SAME ``bootstrap_first_phase`` path
        :meth:`_phase_supply_seeds` uses for the flight's own store-routed
        seed, ONCE, before any contact.

        Branch A carries no overrides and IS the cell's own request. Rather
        than trust that by construction, this method still builds A's router
        INDEPENDENTLY (zero knobs, no release_swap) and checks that it
        reproduces ``value_seed_for_first_phase`` -- the SAME mapping the
        caller already computed through :meth:`_phase_supply_seeds` and is
        about to hand the runner as ``bootstrap_value_ids`` -- row for row,
        before any branch's request is composed. This is phase 1's
        non-circular delivering-arm check (``rails.runner.settle``, "the
        delivering supply-variant arm resolves a different supply..."),
        MOVED to the seed: Perception has no per-row ``settle`` to check it
        in, so it is checked here instead. The twin (T) needs no router of
        its own: design section 3 states plainly "T takes A's seed".

        Returns ``({branch_id: {sample_id: (value_id, ...)}}, (branch
        identity receipt, ...))``. The receipt's ``identity_sha256`` is the
        SAME axes-plus-implementation identity :meth:`_phase_seed_inputs`
        binds a prepared artifact to (:func:`_perception_branches_identity`
        plus the same module hashes), computed here so a caller can pin it
        as a branch's own ``prepared_seed`` later; this method does not
        itself write an artifact file -- design section 5 names that as this
        program's own offline preparation step
        (:meth:`prepare_perception_branch_seeds`), out of reach for an
        in-flight runtime method.

        Item-4 GAP close (design section 5 item 4): a B branch (never A or
        T -- :func:`~speech_aware_evidence_acquisition.rails.supply_variants
        .parse_perception_branches` refuses a ``prepared_seed`` on either)
        that declares its own ``prepared_seed`` pin is BOUND here instead of
        recomputed: :meth:`_load_perception_branch_seed` loads and verifies
        the prepared artifact against ``seed_inputs`` (the SAME
        :meth:`_phase_seed_inputs` identity :meth:`prepare_perception_branch_
        seeds` bound it to) and this method refuses on any mismatch, exactly
        as :meth:`_phase_supply_seeds` refuses a stale
        ``prepared_phase_supply`` pin -- so the SAME bytes fly regardless of
        whether ``lease_metadata_present`` or anything else about this
        environment differs from the offline preparation run. A branch with
        no ``prepared_seed`` is unaffected: it is computed live exactly as
        before, so every existing caller that never declares one (every cell
        written before this artifact existed) is byte-for-byte unchanged.
        Declaring a pin while ``seed_inputs`` is ``None`` is a caller defect,
        refused rather than silently falling back to a live recompute that
        would defeat the pin's whole purpose.

        the knowledge-requery kind: kind (b) reaches Perception directly
        through the acquisition seat's own re-observation node and needs no
        store access at all, and kind (c) fails closed by name inside
        ``rails.acquisition`` itself with no registry bound.

        ``native_config`` declares ``acquisition.budget.

        * ABSENT (every config written before E36b, including the flown
          B9a-rec fragment): the pre-E36b re-query, byte for byte. RE-RUNS
          the exact ``supply_for_phase`` callable the Solver's own supply
          already is -- same specs, same pinned vector files, same provider
          factories, same rank/fuse policy -- against the CURRENT trajectory
          state, then RESTRICTS the result to the caller's state tokens and
          drops anything the row already holds. The 2026-09-22 B9a-rec read
          found this EMPTY BY CONSTRUCTION on every row: the selection this
          re-runs and the exclusion set the caller passes are the same ids,
          so the intersection is always empty
          (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-22-e36b-findings-keyed-requery-
          design.md section 2).
        * PRESENT: searches the WHOLE released composite snapshot instead of
          the Solver's own selection -- values NOT in the caller's exclusion
          set whose content or facet ids share a token with the caller's
          state filters -- ranked by an inverse-document-frequency score
          over that snapshot's own token vocabulary
          (``rails.acquisition.RetrievalPolicy``; design note section 3),
          ties broken by value id for determinism, capped at
          ``max_items_per_acquisition``.

        Both forms spend zero model contacts and zero network: every byte
        comes from the snapshot(s) this runtime already loaded and
        hash-verified before the flight.

        pinned to its own ``id_slot``.

        Invariants, and why each is what it is:

        * **Exactly one contact per sample.** No batching of several samples
          into one prompt -- the arm under test is a one-contact direct
          baseline and merging prompts would change what is measured.
        * **A worker owns one slot for its whole life** (``0..workers-1``,
          taken once from a free-slot queue and never returned), so no two
          in-flight requests ever share a llama-server slot and the
          per-sample slot-affinity semantics the sentinel encodes are
          preserved by construction. For a one-contact policy that is the
          whole of affinity: a sample makes exactly one request, so
          "the sample's requests share a slot" is trivially true.
        * **At most ``workers`` requests in flight**, because the pool has
          exactly that many threads. Queue depth is therefore irrelevant
          here and is deliberately not a knob: with one contact per sample
          there is no second request behind a sample to pipeline, so the
          only thing a deeper queue could add is more in-flight requests
          than slots, which is exactly what the slot pinning forbids.
        * **Deterministic order.** Samples are handed out in
          ``self._samples`` order and results are collected back into that
          order, so the sealed outputs rows do not depend on completion
          timing.
        * **Trace safety, verified rather than assumed.**
          ``core.tracing.TraceSink.emit`` serialises its own write on a
          lock (one open handle, flushed per record since 2026-09-26), so
          two workers could not tear a line -- but the trace's RECORD ORDER
          would then depend on completion timing, so concurrent workers
          still must not write it directly. Each task therefore emits into
          its own ``core.tracing.TraceBuffer`` (bound through the contextvar
          ``set_current_trace_buffer``, which is per-thread), and the parent
          flushes those buffers one at a time, in sample order, through
          ``FrozenCoreClient.flush_trace_buffer`` -- which serializes on the
          client's own ``_state_lock``. The client's request counter and
          timings, and the adapter's budget and metering counters, ARE
          already lock-guarded (``_state_lock``/``_metering_lock``), which
          is why nothing else needs one here.
        * **A failure aborts cleanly.** Remaining work is cancelled and the
          first exception is re-raised, but every buffer that did complete
          is still flushed first, so the durable trace keeps what actually
          happened rather than losing it to the abort.

        no speech-feature packet, by
        ``e0.d2_leakage._construction_visibility``'s own strict equality.

        buffer-slice contacts -> one stitched hypothesis, run by the obs
        driver (owner Decision 12-F item #9, 2026-09-08).

        **This stage delegates; it does not reimplement.** ``core.driver.
        run_experiment`` is the ONE obs harness -- it resolves the run's
        evidence through ``core.evidence`` and proves its D1 identity and
        derivation chain, builds the per-run ``core.model.SliceRegistry`` the
        adapter enforces slice binding against, constructs the single
        ``core.model.FrozenCoreAdapter`` that reserves this attempt, emits the
        per-sample OBS/ORG/SUPPLY preamble, runs the prefetch pipeline when
        the fragment declares one, writes ``<run_id>.outputs.jsonl`` in the
        bundle contract's own field set, and closes its trace sink. A second
        copy of any of that inside this class would be exactly the parallel
        harness the owner's 2026-09-03 rule forbids, and would make an
        Earnings number produced here incomparable with the sealed Earnings
        numbers produced there.

        What FlightRuntime contributes is the envelope the obs driver never
        had: preflight (composition, split identity, the ExecutionPlan, the
        gate, the exposure-row re-check, the clean-tree assertion, the
        prompt-budget assessment), preprocess, serve/attach to the resident
        always-on session (E7), then seal and score once through
        ``core.scoring_batch``.

        Two deliberate differences from the phase-program dispatch:

        * **No ``FrozenCoreClient``.** The obs policy's single door is the
          adapter's ``request``; the client is the rails ``messages`` shim
          over that same adapter, and building one here would open the
          attempt twice.
        * **The ``id_slot`` sentinel is NOT pre-resolved.** ``_decoding_params``
          collapses it to slot 0 because the phase harness dispatches one
          contact at a time; the obs executors resolve it themselves, per
          sample, from the run's dispatch pool -- which is the whole point of
          per-sample slot affinity. The composed value therefore reaches the
          driver exactly as the fragment wrote it.

        (:meth:`phase_supply_artifact_identity`) and reports, per artifact,
        ``{key, relpath, sha256, identity_ok, seed_ok, reason, difference}``.

        :func:`_merge_unconditional_first_phase`, after preflight, preprocess
        and serve had been paid for and the attempt opened. For a pinned cell
        this costs one artifact load plus the store's own per-flight-constant
        route, and a cell that pins nothing never reaches it.

        Nothing is reported for a cell that pins no prepared artifact, and
        nothing for a policy that never loads one (``fixed`` and the obs
        policies dispatch outside ``_dispatch_phase_program``), so this costs
        exactly the cells it protects.

        A pinned phase-recall artifact is loaded by ``_resolve_phase_supply``
        while the phase-program binding is built, so its report carries the

        UNION of every declared predecessor's replayed COMPLETE rows and this
        attempt's own live rows -- every complete row kept, nothing selected.
        Every half is rendered by the SAME :meth:`_canonical_output_rows`
        stage: the replay supplies the phase results and the
        ``rails.core_client.RequestTiming`` records the live dispatch would
        have supplied (``core.flight.resume``), so a kept row is byte
        identical to the row its own predecessor would have sealed. When the
        union covers the whole roster (:attr:`is_seal_only`), ``live_rows`` is
        empty and every sealed row is kept.

        The second return value is ``None`` for an ordinary flight, a single
        ``predecessor_attempt``-shaped dict for exactly one predecessor
        (byte-identical to the pre-E10d shape), or a LIST of such dicts (one
        per predecessor that kept a row of this resume) for more than one --
        :meth:`seal` tells them apart by type.

        The third return value is ``None`` unless :attr:`is_seal_only`, in
        which case it is every predecessor's replayed
        :class:`~core.flight.resume.ReplayedEpisodeResult`, in this flight's
        own roster order -- the SAME objects :meth:`_rows_from_phase_summaries`
        already rendered the outputs from, handed back rather than
        re-replayed a second time, so :meth:`seal` can render a seal-only
        ``phases.json`` from the one replay this method already performed.

        The merged rows are emitted in this flight's own roster order, so the
        sealed file does not advertise which half a row came from; the
        manifest block(s) and the trace custody do.
